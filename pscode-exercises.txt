// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c
print c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers
add the 2 numbers together
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
if number is evenly divisible by 2 = even(true)
if number is not evenly divisible by 2 = odd(false)
print on the screen if the number is even(true) or odd(false)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3
1 is smallest(minimum) and 5 is largest(maximum)

ask for 5 numbers
num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum / 5 = average num
Print on the screen the average num
num1 = smallest
num5 = largest
print on the screen the smallest(minimum) number
print on the screen the largest(maximum) number
